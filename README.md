# WiFi CSI Activity Prediction with CNN
## Overview

This project explores the effectiveness of using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) for predicting patient activities. Specifically, it investigates the differences in performance when training and inferencing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using two different types of CSI data:

1. Full complex number data.
2. Only the real component of the data.

The goal of this analysis is to determine whether the full complex number data offers a significant advantage over using only the real component in terms of prediction accuracy and model performance.

## Motivation
I undertook this task during my capstone project at deakin univercity. It seemed like an interesting task and application for machine learning methods I had recently learnt.
